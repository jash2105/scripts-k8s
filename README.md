# scripts-k8s
Welcome to the "scripts-k8s" repository! Here, you'll find a collection of scripts that automate some simple tasks for managing Kubernetes clusters. Yes, you could follow the docs to accomplish these tasks, but where's the fun in that? I prefer to complicate things a bit more.

Initially, I thought of writing custom operators and controllers for these use cases, but then I realized that everyone in the Kubernetes community is already doing that. Writing operators for everything is overkill and, honestly, a bit stupid. However, the process of writing these scripts was a great learning experience.

Remember, every system ends up with some technical debt. The goal is to keep improving. Enjoy using (and maybe cursing) these scripts!
